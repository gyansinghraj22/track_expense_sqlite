# --- SECURITY & ENVIRONMENT (CRITICAL FOR FIREBASE/SECRETS) ---

# 1. Firebase Configuration (MUST HIDE)
# Hides the main configuration files for both platforms
/android/app/google-services.json
/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

# 2. Local Environment Variables
# Hides any environment variable files used locally
.env
.env.*

# 3. Code Generation (Hide generated files unless you rely on them being tracked)
# The *.g.dart is for packages like json_serializable or Hive, which are usually generated locally.
# If you are using freezed or hive, you might want to hide *.g.dart files and run the generator on deployment.
# If you are only using bloc/riverpod code generation, often you want to keep them.
# Use this line ONLY if you intend to regenerate all files on every machine:
# **/*.g.dart

# 4. Git ignored files
.gitignore
